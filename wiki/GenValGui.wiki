It means: *Generator* *Validation* *GUIs*

Basically, we can separate into three different steps the internal behaviour of that framework.
  * *The first step:* "Mark your POJO classes" 
In the first step the user indicates (using annotations) the POJO classes that will be available to show into the browser.

To implement the first step [represents the info], we use three annotations (_keep in mind, be patient. We’ll see their use in an example later_):

 - *@GwtValidation:* Represents the entry point to the validation API, you must include the type of classes that will be validated.

 - *@GvgInfoAnnotation:* Like the previous annotation, you must include here the classes that will be parsed to generate their GUIs.

 - *@Caption:* This annotation is used in the POJO classes to indicate the name of the columns. You can customize the appearance of the GUIs.

Those annotations are placed in the principal class (entry point) of this framework (keep in mind, it’ll useful to understand completely the example):

  * *The second:* "Generate the code in compilation time" 
The second step is to generate the code of that GUIs, using *Deferred Binding* (to generate the code in compilation time), *CellWidget* (the classes that will represent the attributes and *client databinding*) and the *JSR-303* (to implement all the validation behaviour).

  * *The third step*
