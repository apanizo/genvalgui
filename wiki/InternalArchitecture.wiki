= Internal Architecture =

The internal process to generate the GUIs, are composed by two differentiated steps.

== Step 1: Save the info into a tree==

The first step is the attendant to parse all de POJO classes that the developer was introduced (in our example Person.class, Email.class, Adress.class ...), in order to save the information that we'll need in the next step.

|| *Why are we interested in save the information and not passed directly?* ||

Because one of the principal purpose of this framework is the *scalability* and maintenance. 

If in the future we want to introduce new information to save (for example a new annotation that allows attach a css file) we can do it in an easy way, we don't need only a few changes.

|| * Which is the classes that are involved?? * ||  Save the information into a tree ||

  * *!GvgGeneratorNode*
That class represents the node of the tree. It saves one sub-tree for each POJO class that the user has introduced previously.
  
  * *!GvgGeneratorNodeClass*

That class saves the name of the CellTable that will be associated into the next step.
Also saves an ArrayList ofGbgGeneratorNodeField. It represents the information of each attribute that the POJO class has.

  * *!GvgGeneratorNodeField*

In order to save all the information of each attribute we use this class (constraints, a reference to the parent and child nodes (for example if you have an attribute like: ArrayList< String>, we'll have two nodes, one represents the ArrayList and other represents the String type.
