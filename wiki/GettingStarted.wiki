You must know:

|| *The concept of Deferred Binding*: || <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsDeferred.html">Dev Guide of GWT (*Deferred Binging*)</a>||

  || With this technique the GenValGui framework creates in compilation time the implementation of the GUIs of the POJOs. In order to support the users validation needs, the generated code includes the implementation of Validation instructions (groups, built-in constraints, custom error messages, and custom  constraints)||

|| *Knowledge of the Validation API based on standard JSR-303* || <a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/bean_validation-1.0-fr-oth-JSpec/">The spec</a> | <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/BeanValidation">The implementation of that spec in the client side of GWT</a> ||

|| *The principal purpose of this framework* || [GenValGui] ||

   ||The !GenValGui framework allows automatic generating of GUIs from the data model of your application. These GUI´s supports automatic data-binding in the client side (if you made any change in the information it saves in the Structure Data of the App, you must be careful because there isn’t support to transport the changes to the DB yet), and an intensive use of data, because the generated code uses !CellWidgets||
