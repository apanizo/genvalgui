== Before to start==
You must know:

|| *The concept of Deferred Binding*: || <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsDeferred.html">Dev Guide of GWT (*Deferred Binging*)</a>||

  || With this technique the GenValGui framework creates in compilation time the implementation of the GUIs of the POJOs. In order to support the users validation needs, the generated code includes the implementation of Validation instructions (groups, built-in constraints, custom error messages, and custom  constraints)||

|| *Knowledge of the Validation API based on standard JSR-303* || <a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/bean_validation-1.0-fr-oth-JSpec/">The spec</a> | <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/BeanValidation">The implementation of that spec in the client side of GWT</a> ||

|| *The principal purpose of this framework* || [GenValGui] ||

   ||The !GenValGui framework allows automatic generating of GUIs from the data model of your application. These GUI´s supports automatic data-binding in the client side (if you made any change in the information it saves in the Structure Data of the App, you must be careful because there isn’t support to transport the changes to the DB yet), and an intensive use of data, because the generated code uses !CellWidgets||

==The basic operation of that framework==
  # Create your POJO and introduce in them the Constraints that you need.
  # Mark in the GenValGui framework a reference to the POJOs created in the previous step.
  # Declare an instance of the GenValGui framework
  # Use the instance of the step 3 to represent the different GUIs of the classes created

==How to use step by step==

  ||  *1* ||<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html">download</a> the lest version of the GWT SDK ||

  || *2* || <a href="http://code.google.com/p/genvalgui/downloads/list">download</a> the last version of *!GenValGui.jar* from  and include it into your project||

  || *3* ||Create the POJO classes that you need (_in the example I put the files into the *com.example.myproject.shared*_) ||

  || *4* || Create the next structure (_you can download the example project_) ||
       || <img src="http://genvalgui.googlecode.com/svn/resources/imgs/estructura.png"  alt="Step 1 - Architecture" height="470" width="370" />  ||

       || *com.example.myproject.genvalgui* ||
       In this package you must include the classes that bring the entry point information to the framework. As you can see, you have to indicate the groups and the classes that will be validate (into the *@!GwtValidation* annotation), the classes that will be automatically generated (into the *@!GvgInfoAnnotation*) and the method createBuilder.
       
       All this content must be in a class called GenValGuiFactory (you can copy/paste and change only add your information). When finished, the GWT compiler via deferred binding allows you to use the magic method:
{{{
    public T CellTable  buildGui(Class c, Object o);
}}}
that allows create automatically the UI’s and have an instant access to the different user interfaces. ||
